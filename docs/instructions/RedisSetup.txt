**********************************************************************************************

1. Run installation using command on all servers you want to make part of redis cluster:
    sudo apt-get install redis-server

2. Copy Sample Redis Conf from sample-conf folder and paste it in '/etc/redis/'. It will replace existing file.
   Now go over following properties:

    tcp-keepalive
    maxmemory
    maxmemory-policy
    cluster-enabled yes
    cluster-config-file nodes.conf
    cluster-node-timeout 5000
    cluster-slave-validity-factor 2

3. Now when all nodes will be independently setup, we will create cluster using below commands.
    a. CLUSTER MEET : to connect nodes to each other
    b. CLUSTER ADDSLOTS : to assign slots to cluster node
    c. SLAVEOF : to mark node slave of some other node
